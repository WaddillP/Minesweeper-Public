# Minesweeper - Python

This code uses Pygame to create a playable Minesweeper game.
For those who are not aware, Minesweeper is a game played on a grid where you press a square and then a certain amount of squares surrounding that square are broken. The outer squares will have numbers on them to signify how many bombs are nearby. The player must use logic to sweep through the grid and clear out every square that does not have a bomb.

Features:

A garaunteed clean break on the first press.

Randomly generated bomb locations.

The ability to flag where you think bombs are.

Custom bomb and Flag sprites.

A running counter of how many flags you have left, you start with as many flags as there are bombs.

3 Playable game modes that are pickable on the starting screen.

A custom ending screen whether you win or lose.
