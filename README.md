This code uses Pygame to create a playable Minesweeper game.
For those who are not aware, Minesweeper is a game played on a grid where you press a square and then a certain amount of squares surrounding that square are broken. The outer squares will have numbers on them to signify how many bombs are nearby. The player must use logic to sweep through the grid and clear out every square that does not have a bomb.
